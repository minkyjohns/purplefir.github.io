## Welcome to Purple Fir Software, LLC.

We are a software company based in Corvallis, Oregon.

Our main product is [Cytosnap](https://www.cytosnap.com), a computer vision tool that automates the common, tedious laboratory procedure of counting cells in a hemocytometer. It helps free scientists and researchers to do what they do best - science!

These are some of the tools we used to build the app:

- SaltStack
- Django REST Framework
- ReactJS
- Phonegap
- OpenCV and dlib (Computer vision)

Needless to say, we used several awesome packages from various open source contributors whose hard work makes projects like this possible.
